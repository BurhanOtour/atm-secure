This is a integrity break implementation.

There is no form form of bank and atm handshake or validation done to prevent replay attacks by MITM. Steps to produce

1. Atm sends -a ted -n 2000.00 to Bank via MITM.
2. Atm sends -a ted -w 500.00 to Bank via MITM. (MITM saves this command).
3. MITM sends the saved command to the Bank without involving ATM.

As a result, ted remaining balance is 1000.00 instead of 1500,00
