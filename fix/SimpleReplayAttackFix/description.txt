Primary this fix is related to a replay attack. For example for the bug break91 (1128). A replay attack was happening by creating two accounts. Mitm is dropping the send request and was attempting to send the old response to the client. In order to fix this we have added UIID in the transmission packet while sending request from the client to server, Upon response receiving we are validating if it is the response is same for the request which was sent earlier if it is not then its invalid response and atm exists with 63. While making changes for this attack additionally two oher bugs [break-17-integrity-kill-3 (421)] and [17_memory_overflow (245)] were fixed too.For bug break-17-integrity-kill-3 (421) it was related to not having a valid catch exception, and 17_memory_overflow (245) was related to using readline() method while reading from socket instead of reading from socket stream.
