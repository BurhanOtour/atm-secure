Primarly this fix is related to memory overflow. The bug 17_memory_overflow(245) is the only bug related to this fix. Earlier we were using readline() along BufferReader and PrintWriter. 
Now while reading and writing from the socket, we have changed it to readUTF() and writeUTF(). These methods will read and write stream, and do not rely on "endline"(\n). Hence memory overflow attack is mitigated.
