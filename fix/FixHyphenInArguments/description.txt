This fix aims to resolve the bug (358_breakOneForTeam17) related to extra hyphen provided for arguments value. Earlier we were using the library that separate arguments by-. That`s why when it was processing the argument "-ana-mi" it separated into 2 options ["-a","na"] and ["-m","i"]. That was incorrect because by requirements account name and card name can have the hyphen. Now we substituting hyphen(-) with the hash(#) for library parsing. And then we are reverting it back.
