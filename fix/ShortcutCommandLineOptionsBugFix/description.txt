The command line argument handler in our client app is limited to handling more advanced, yet valid, form of options (such as -gc <cardfile>, -ga <account> etc).
Such options are valid because the -g option doesn't require any argument value.
So, when such options were provided to our client app, the command line parser will reject it as it considers the input as an unrecognized option.
Since, an option like "-gc" forms two options together ""-g -c", the idea of the solution is to split, for example the previous option, into two valid options recognized by the command line parser
that means, "-gc <cardfile>" becomes "-g -c <cardfile>" through a pre-processing step for the command line arguments.

In other words, we pre-process (expand) the args[] array provided for the main method in the client java app so we have an equivalent array recognized by the parser.
