The auth file content follows a specific structure (JSON Format). And we are using Gson JSON library to serialize/ deserialize between that auth file JSON
content and its corresponding AuthFile object. If the content of a file provided for atm as an auth file doesn't comply to that format, the Gson library will raise
JsonSyntaxException which will eventually end up with a crash. Since providing an invalid auth file (like providing card file as an auth file) is considered logically wrong,
the solution is to catch the exception and exit with error code 255.
