Hi Martin, 

I just re-added the code since it was deleted. 
The However, the test happened earlier because 
We asked you to rerun a test with deleted code in git to learn how the infrastructure was behaving and it was succeeded. 

So I was just checking and I saw that the code was missing so I added it as it is. 

Burhan.
